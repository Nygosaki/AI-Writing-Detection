# AI-Writing-Detection

## IMPORTANT: IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES, FIRST DO pip3 install -r requirements.txt COMMAND INSDIE THE FOLDER

This tool will parse the inputted text into many different existing AI writing detection tools and return the results to you. This is to be able to scan text with as many tools as possible without having to do it manually.  
  
Please note that this is not finished yet.  
  
## Requirements

Python 3.11.2 or later  
Pip 22.0.1 or later  
  
## How to install

1. Download the zip file of this entire project  
2. Extract the zip file  
3. open CMD in the folder, and run "pip install -r requirements.txt"  
  
## How to use

1. Create a txt file(s) with text that you want to be checked. If you have multiple of thse files, have them all in the same folder.  
2. You can configure the script in setup.py
3. Run the `guiStart.py` python script in your preffered way (via CMD, IDE, etc)  
If you want to run the script through CMD, open CMD in the folder. You can also open the CMD normally and navigate to the folder via cd (for example "cd C:\Users\MeLikeFish\Documents\AI-Writing-Detection").  
Then type in "python guiStart.py".  

## Avoiding Detection  

There are many ways to avoid detection. Some include automated ways; for example first typing  
"When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?"  
  
Another way to avoid detection is to ask the AI itself to search on how to avoid detection, and then make it follow those reccomendations.  
People can also only use the AI as input, and write the text themselves.  
  
This is to say that these tools will not detect all text written by AI, and they may also flag content wrongly.  
In the position of an educator, before making a conclusion, I would invite the student to my office and let them tell me about the text they written, the procces, the subject at hand, and other associated information. If the student can not respond well to your questions, it is likely that they did not write the text themselves.  
As AI Writing has gotten so advanced, it has become increidbly harad to detect tools that are made for avoiding these checks. Without interviewing the student, you can also check the document's edit history (On for example google docs) to check for large ammounts of text being pasted in.
